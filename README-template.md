# Frontend Mentor - Conference Ticket Generator Solution

This is a solution to the [Conference Ticket Generator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* Complete the form with their details
* Receive form validation messages if:

  * Any field is missed
  * The email address is not formatted correctly
  * The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
* Complete the form only using their keyboard
* Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
* See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first responsive design
* Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

* **Passing data between JavaScript files** using export/import modules.
* **Base64 encoding**, especially how to convert uploaded images into base64 for inline ticket previews.
* **Form validation** with custom error messages.
* **Clearing input errors dynamically** on user correction (real-time feedback).
* **Handling file uploads** and validating file type and size.
* **Creating of random ticket ID** using incrementing numbers
* **Using padStart**

Example: handling image preview and base64 conversion

```js
function toBase64(file) {
  // create promise since its an async function
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    // use FileReader browser api
    const reader = new FileReader();

    // read the file and coverts it to base64
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);

    // when successfully read, this resolves the promise 
    reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result);

    // rejects promise in case of error
    reader.onerror = (error) => reject(error);
  });
}
```

### Continued development

I want to:

* Explore better ways to validate forms using libraries like Yup or Validator.js.
* Handle error messages in a more accessible way for screen readers.
* Practice generating and downloading final ticket designs as images or PDFs.
* Implement drag-and-drop for image upload.
